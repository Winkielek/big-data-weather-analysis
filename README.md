## Project PoC

The aim of this project is to create an Big Data architecture, able to handle accumulating and analysis of weather and air pollution data. This data would be aquired from two separate APIs, to be later on transformed using NIFI software. Other used technologies used in this project are Hadoop, Hive and HBase for data storage and Apache Spark for all kinds of analysis.
